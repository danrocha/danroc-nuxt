I'm **Daniel da Rocha**, a **Brazilian** self-taught **front end developer** and formally-educated **architect**, based in **Berlin**.

In the past 4+ years, as I learned and built a lot of side projects, I became comfortable working both in the front end and in the back end. My main tools include **JavaScript**, **VueJS**, HTML5, CSS3, **Python**, **NuxtJS**, **GraphQL**, **SQL**, Figma, Adobe CC, git/Github, among others. Also, I feel I can pick up and learn anything I need to get the job done.

Also, in the past 10+ years, through my career in architecture, I mastered the ability to tackle **complex projects**, to devise simple and elegant solutions, and to deal with **diverse and complex team** configurations; valuable soft skills in any industry.

I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations.
