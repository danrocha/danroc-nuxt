I'm **Daniel**, a **Brazilian** self-taught **front end developer** and formally-educated **architect**, based in **Berlin**.

Son of a pair of computer scientists, I've been around computers my whole life. We always had the latest and greatest back then: **XT with a red screen**! **CD-ROM**, wooow. **Windows 98**! It wasn't long before I dived into coding: always accompanied either by a _The [insert language name here] Bible_ or some O'Reilly guide, I went through PHP, MySQL, Actionscript (Flash yeah!), lots of HTML and some CSS back then. I was the first to have a website and even got a little "famous" **blog** and **podcast** back when you had to download the MP3 with iTunes and sync it with your iPod.

Somewhere along the way, I fell in love with **Architecture** and decided it was to become my profession. After all, "I'll build real things, real buildings, not just online stuff." For a long time I loved it: I worked my ass off and did pretty well in my career. And even during it all, **I was always coding**. It started with Maya 3D and Python scripting back in school (generative design!), followed by Grasshopper, Rhino, and more Python scripting, in practice.

In my free time, I would go deep into **modern web development**, going crazy with all the possibilities at my fingertips. I felt I could build anything I wanted, fast, have people using it, learn from it, and iterate. This cycle is non-existent in architecture. A project you design today might take years to be ready. By then you'll have moved on, missing out on learning what was actually working or not for your end-user.

I want more of the **never ending feedback and learning cycle** in my life. I want to have a stronger connection with people who are interacting with my work. That is why I am switching careers. From years in architecture, I'll bring all I learned into tech. **And keep on building**. Because "online stuff" turned out to be quite important, after all.
